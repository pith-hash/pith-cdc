//! The FastCDC mask table: one cut-point test mask per target chunk-size
//! level, plus the normalization-level selector.
//!
//! A candidate byte position is a cut point when `fp & mask == 0`. A mask
//! with `k` one-bits declares a cut with probability about `2^-k` per byte,
//! so `MASKS[i]` — which always carries exactly `i` one-bits — targets an
//! average chunk size of `2^i` bytes. The one-bits are spread over the
//! upper half of the word rather than packed into the low bits: that is the
//! paper's "zero-padded mask" trick, which stretches the effective sliding
//! window of the Gear fingerprint to roughly 48 bytes so it matches the
//! window Rabin-based CDC uses.
//!
//! `MASKS` is indexed directly by `round(log2(avg_size))`, so indices 0
//! through 5 are padding and 6 through 21 are the sixteen usable levels,
//! 64 B (`2^6`) through 2 MiB (`2^21`). Indices 22 through 25 extend the
//! table to 16 MiB; 5 and 25 exist so normalization level 3 still resolves
//! for the extreme table ends. Every entry below is pinned bit-for-bit in
//! `tests/tables.rs` — a wrong bit here is silent corruption, not a crash.

/// Cut-point test masks, one per target chunk-size level.
///
/// `MASKS[6]` targets 64 B, `MASKS[21]` targets 2 MiB: sixteen levels, the
/// table the design spec calls "bảng mask 16 mức". Entries outside that
/// span exist only to keep the index arithmetic total: `0..=4` are padding,
/// `22..=24` extend to 16 MiB, and 5/25 are only reachable at normalization
/// level 3 on the smallest and largest `avg_size` values.
///
/// Provenance: indices 6–17 match the `g_condition_mask` table in the
/// FastCDC authors' C reference implementation (the destor tree); the rest
/// continue the same spread-bit pattern. The three masks named in the 2016
/// paper's Algorithm 1 correspond to `MASKS[13]` (`MaskA`, 13 bits),
/// `MASKS[15]` (`MaskS`, 15 bits) and `MASKS[11]` (`MaskL`, 11 bits) for an
/// 8 KiB target — same bit counts, but deliberately different bit
/// placement, so do not "fix" them to the paper's literals.
