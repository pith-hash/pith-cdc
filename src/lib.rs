//! FastCDC content-defined chunking with the 16-level gear mask table.
//!
//! Part of the `pith` zero-dependency hashing suite: every suite crate
//! depends only on other `pith-*` crates, so the whole suite resolves
//! without a single third-party registry package.
//!
//! The algorithm is the one described by Wen Xia et al., "FastCDC: a Fast
//! and Efficient Content-Defined Chunking Approach for Data Deduplication",
//! USENIX ATC '16 (and its TPDS 2020 journal extension): a byte is a cut
//! point when `gear_fingerprint & mask == 0`, where the fingerprint rolls
//! one byte per step through the 256-entry [`GEAR`] table and `mask` is
//! chosen from [`MASKS`] by the target average size and the normalization
//! level. The constants are pinned
//! bit-for-bit by `tests/tables.rs`; a single flipped bit in either table
//! changes every boundary downstream.
//!
//! Two rolling hashes live here because the paper only needs one of them:
//!
//! * [`Gear`], the `fp = (fp << 1) + Gear[b]` rolling fingerprint the
//!   chunker itself uses. A byte falls out of the window on its own once
//!   it has been shifted off the 64-bit end, so no eviction term exists.
//! * [`Buzhash64`], the classic rotate-XOR rolling hash over an explicit
//!   64-byte window, exported for chunk fingerprinting and other callers
//!   that want a real sliding window whose contents can be evicted.
//!
//! ```
//! use pith_cdc::{FastCdc, Normalization};
//!
//! let data = vec![0xabu8; 1 << 16];
//! let chunker = FastCdc::new(&data, 2048, 8192, 32768).unwrap();
//! let total: usize = chunker.map(|c| c.length).sum();
//! assert_eq!(total, data.len());
//! ```
